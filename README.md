# Kubernetes Prompt Portfolio

| NAME | PROMPT | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
 ----- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| app.yaml                | Analyze this basic Kubernetes Deployment manifest (`app.yaml`) for best practices. Identify any missing but recommended fields (e.g., `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, resource limits) and suggest improvements.             | Basic deployment manifest for a web app; missing probes or limits may reduce reliability. | [app.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app.yaml)                               |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml  | Explain how the `livenessProbe` in this Kubernetes deployment works. What will happen if the probe fails? Suggest how to improve the `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, or `failureThreshold` for better resiliency.       | Demonstrates a `livenessProbe`, useful for auto-restarting stuck containers.              | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml)   |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | Compare the `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` in a Kubernetes deployment. Analyze the configuration in `app-readinessProbe.yaml` and explain what conditions must be met before the pod receives traffic.                    | Shows when the pod becomes "ready" to accept traffic, critical for rolling updates.       | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml   | This manifest uses a `volumeMount`. Analyze how the volume is configured in `app-volumeMounts.yaml`. What type of volume is used (e.g., `emptyDir`, `hostPath`, `configMap`)? What are the implications for data persistence?   | Introduces mounting volumes to containers â€” affects pod-level data persistence.           | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml)     |
| app-cronjob.yaml        | Review the Kubernetes CronJob defined in `app-cronjob.yaml`. What schedule does it follow, and how does Kubernetes ensure that jobs don't overlap? Suggest how to handle failed job retries and missed schedules.               | Scheduled background job that runs on a timer. Useful for periodic tasks.                 | [app-cronjob.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-cronjob.yaml)               |
| app-job.yaml            | Explain the lifecycle of a Kubernetes Job based on `app-job.yaml`. How many pods will be created? What happens when the job completes? Analyze the `restartPolicy` and its effect.                                              | One-off task runner. Describes completion behavior and pod control.                       | [app-job.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-job.yaml)                       |
| app-multicontainer.yaml | This manifest defines multiple containers in a single pod. Analyze the interaction between the containers in `app-multicontainer.yaml`. Is one acting as a sidecar or init container? How do they share volumes or communicate? | Multi-container pod use case. Useful for sidecar patterns or tightly coupled services.    | [app-multicontainer.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources.yaml      | Analyze the resource requests and limits defined in `app-resources.yaml`. Why is it important to define CPU and memory requests/limits in production? Suggest reasonable values based on a lightweight Go application.          | Specifies container resource allocation for cluster scheduling and QoS.                   | [app-resources.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-resources.yaml)           |
| app-secret-env.yaml     | Review how environment variables are injected using Kubernetes Secrets in `app-secret-env.yaml`. Is this a secure way to manage secrets? Suggest improvements or alternatives like `External Secrets` or sealed secrets.        | Demonstrates secret management using environment variables.                               | [app-secret-env.yaml](https://github.com/fedor22i/AsciiArtify/blob/master/yaml/app-secret-env.yaml)         |
